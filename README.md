It should work in any Rails 5 allowed environment, but just in case I have use Vagrant installation. The vagrantfile is included.

## Methods

user.increment_coins(amount, reason)

user.decrement_coins(amount, reason)

I have added a Transaction model for storing the transactions.

All new methods have test and also the new model.

Just run rspec.
